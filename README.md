# Anime Corner Rankings

(Insert Deployed Site Link Here)

Anime Corner releases a ranking of the most popular anime based on episodes that air during the week, and all of this data is collated and then presented in a graphic that is distributed on all their social media feeds. Each week can be found on their own posts [here](https://animecorner.me/category/anime-corner/rankings/anime-of-the-week/). 

The aim of this site is to consolidate all of this data into one place where users can navigate through the weekly rankings for each of the [anime seasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/anime_related_terms), and also learn more about an anime in the ranking if they want to.

**Site Goals**:
- To provide members of the Anime Corner community a pleasant experience for viewing the weekly rankings.
- Make it easier for users to quickly find a past ranking without browsing through a list of blog posts.
- Provide details about an anime in the ranking for users not familiar with the anime.

**User Goals**:
- Discover the top 10 anime's of the week from Anime Corner.
- Browse through the different weekly rankings from each season.
- Find additional information for an anime in the ranking.

**Developer Goals**: 
- Develop a professional(ish) project that showcases my first experience with Javascript.
- Demonstrate understanding of working with API's, databases and also web scraping.
- Demonstrate test driven development with Jest.
