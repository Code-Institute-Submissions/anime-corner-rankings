# Anime Corner Rankings

(Insert Deployed Site Link Here)

Anime Corner releases a ranking of the most popular anime based on episodes that air during the week, and all of this data is collated and then presented in a graphic that is distributed on all their social media feeds. Each week can be found on their own posts [here](https://animecorner.me/category/anime-corner/rankings/anime-of-the-week/).

The aim of this site is to consolidate all of this data into one place where users can navigate through the weekly rankings for each of the [anime seasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/anime_related_terms), and also learn more about an anime in the ranking if they want to.

The goals for this site are:

- To provide members of the Anime Corner community a pleasant experience for viewing the weekly rankings.
- Make it easier for users to quickly find a past ranking without browsing through a list of blog posts.
- Provide details about an anime in the ranking for users not familiar with the anime.

The goals for the user are:

- Discover the top 10 anime's of the week from Anime Corner.
- Browse through the different weekly rankings from each season.
- Find additional information for an anime in the ranking.

#### Typography

For this project, system font stack was used for the following reasons:

- Performant - No network requests, faster page loads
- Unicode coverage - Lessen usage of icons and instead use unicode such as: `⮅` `⮂` `⮇`
- Familiarity - 'Native' web app look

#### Color

The color palette consists of colors found on the weekly ranking graphic. [WebAim's Contrast Checker Tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was used to check contrast and minor tweaks were made to ensure that all colors were compliant with WCAG 2.0 level AA at the minimum.
