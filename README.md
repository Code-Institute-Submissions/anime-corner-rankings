# Anime Corner Rankings

(Insert Deployed Site Link Here)

Anime Corner releases a ranking of the most popular anime weekly, and all of this data is collated and then presented in a graphic that is distributed on all their social media feeds. Each week can be found on their own posts [here](https://animecorner.me/category/anime-corner/rankings/anime-of-the-week/). 

The aim of this site is to consolidate all this data into a single page that users can use to easily navigate through and peruse. The site can also double up as an anime discovery platform for users looking for their next anime to watch. Users can factor an anime's current popularity in their decision and additional information about each anime and links will be available for every anime in the rankings. 

The goals for this site are:
- To provide members of the Anime Corner community a pleasant experience dedicated to viewing the weekly rankings.
- Make it easier to users to quickly find a past ranking without browsing through a list of blog posts.
- Provide details about an anime in the ranking for users not familiar with the anime.

The goals for the user are:
